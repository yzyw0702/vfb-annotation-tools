## adult\_brain\_transgene\_annotation.xls ##

A spreadsheet for annotating transgene expression in the adult brain.

### Columns: ###

  * Transgene ID
Unique ID for transgene - ideally from FlyBase if available
  * Transgene name
  * Image URL
Integration with VFB and Protege will be much easier if the image is stored on a server with a persistent URL.
  * Image name
  * Expressed in
Content restricted to ontology terms for anatomical structures (e.g. neuropil, tract, neuron) that have some part in the adult brain.
  * Notes
Free text description.


## individual\_adult\_brain\_neuron\_annotation.xls ##

A spreadsheet for capturing general classifications of adult brain neurons and the location of their various parts.

### Columns ###

  * Image URL
  * Image name
  * depicted neuron class
Content restricted to ontology terms for neurons that have some part in the adult brain. (probably should be extended to include more general neuron classes too).
  * neuropil overlapped
Content restricted to ontology terms for neuropils (e.g. ellipsoid body; medulla layer M2) that are part of the adult brain. No need to add this in addition to location synaptic terminals.
  * location of synaptic terminals
Content restricted to ontology terms for neuropils (e.g. ellipsoid body; medulla layer M2) that are part of the adult brain.  No need to add this in addition to location pre/postsynaptic terminals.
  * location of presynaptic terminals
Content restricted to ontology terms for neuropils (e.g. ellipsoid body; medulla layer M2) that are part of the adult brain.
  * location of postsynaptic terminals
Content restricted to ontology terms for neuropils (e.g. ellipsoid body; medulla layer M2) that are part of the adult brain.
  * tract/nerve
Use this to record the tract or nerve that a neuron fasciculaltes with. Content restricted to ontology terms for tracts that are part of the adult brain  or nerves that innervate it.
